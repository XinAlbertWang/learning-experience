\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gender wage gap is persistent and prevalent in the US.
       \item This paper shows turnover and human capital dynamics are important factors in explaining gender wage gap.
       \item They establish a structural model of wage dynamics, estimate it using NLSY79 data and do some counterfactual analysis.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They use NLSY79 data and focus on period after the individuals' graduation.
       \item They exclude the individuals who never get employed after 15 years of graduation. Unemployment and out-of-the-labor force are both treated as non-employment state.
       \item They distinguish two group:high school graduates are those who have 12 to 15 years of schooling, college graduates are those who have 16 to 20 years of schooling.
       \item They restrict their sample to non-minority individuals who did not have any child while in school.
       \item They have 1,376 men and 1,331 women in the high school group, and 653 men and 681 women in the college group.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Gender wage gaps over the life-cycle}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $w_{i t}$ denotes the log hourly real wage of individual $i$ in week $t$, $M_{i t}$ denotes the number
        of months worker $i$ has spent in the labor force , and $\tau_y$ are calendar year
        fixed effects. 
         $ w_{i t}=\beta_0Male_i+\sum_{m=1}^{180}[\alpha_m \mathbb{1}[M_{i t}=m]+\beta_m(Male_i \mathbb{1}[M_{i t}=m])]+\tau_y+\varepsilon_{i t}$

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The structure of the model is same for four groups(man-high school,man-college,woman-high school and woman-college).
       \item Workers exit the labor market permanently at rate $\phi$,new inflow of workers enter at same rate.
       \item Workers' initial human capital level, $\varepsilon$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $A(\varepsilon)$ with support $[\underline{\varepsilon}, \bar{\varepsilon}]$. a type $\varepsilon$ worker with
       actual experience $x$ has productivity$ y = \varepsilon e^{\rho x}$.
       \item Jobs are heterogeneous in productivity, $p$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $\Gamma(p)$ with support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$
       \item Every employer posts  wage rate $z$ to all potential applicants,worker gets paid a wage $w = zy$,The productivity of the match $(y, p)$ is $yp$, so employers' profit is $(p-z)y$
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Model}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item A worker can have children in either employment or unemployment at Poisson rate $\gamma_1$
       \item  For those who are employed at childbirth, a share $\eta$ will return to their old jobsâ€” their childcare period is denoted by $OJ$ and ends at rate $\gamma_2$.
       \item Childcare period for who do not return to their old jobs is denoted by $NJ$ and terminates at a different rate $\gamma_3$
       \item Jobs are heterogeneous in productivity, $p$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $\Gamma(p)$ with support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$
       \item  Those who are unemployed at childbirth will enter childcare periods of the $NJ$ type. If the worker has a second child while in $OJ$, she goes into the state $NJ$.The probability that the worker returns to her old job, $\eta$, is taken as exogenous in the model.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Worker Behavior}

    \textbf{Proposition 1}. For a fixed $F(\cdot)$ with bounded and non-negative support, optimal job search implies that all unemployed workers have the same reservation cutoff $z^R$, which exists, is unique and is implicitly defined by\\
   \begin{center}
  $ \zeta_1(z^R-b)+\frac{(r+\phi) \zeta_2}{\lambda_u}(b^{\text {out }}-b)+\rho(b+\frac{\gamma_1}{r+\phi+\gamma_3} b^{\text {out }})$ \\
        $=[\zeta_1(\lambda_u-\lambda_e)-\rho \lambda_u+(r+\phi) \zeta_2] \int_{z^R}^{\bar{z}} \frac{\bar{F}(z)}{r+q(z)-\rho-\frac{\eta \gamma_1 \gamma_2}{r+\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2}} d z $
\end{center} 
        where $\zeta_1=r+\phi+\gamma_1-\frac{\gamma_1 \gamma_3}{r+\phi+\gamma_3}$, $\zeta_2=\frac{\lambda_u \gamma_1 \eta\left(\gamma_3-\gamma_2\right)}{\left(r+\phi+\gamma_3\right)\left(r+\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2\right)}$, $q(z)=\phi+\delta+\gamma_1+\lambda_e \bar{F}(z)$


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Employer}
 
    \textbf{Proposition 2}. The optimal policy function, $z =\xi(p)$, i) can be expressed as \\
     \begin{center}
       $\xi(p)=p-M(\xi(p))^2 \int_{z^R}^p \frac{1}{M(\xi(p^{\prime}))^2} d p^{\prime}$
       \end{center} 
       where  $M(\xi(p))=q(\xi(p))-\frac{\eta \gamma_1 \gamma_2}{\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2}-\rho$ and \\
       ii) $\xi(p)$ is increasing in $p$ so that more productive jobs post higher wage offers. \\

       \textbf{Theorem 1}. For any $\rho > \phi$, a steady-state market equilibrium exists and is unique.

     

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{identification}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  They normalize the minimum worker type $\log(\varepsilon)$ to zero. Workers' initial productivity distribution as $A(\varepsilon) \sim Weibull(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ over the support $[1,\infty)$.
        \item  The productivity distribution of jobs is parametrized as $\Gamma(p) \sim Weibull(\kappa_1,\kappa_2)$ over the support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$.
        \item  Monthly discount factor $r = 0.0041$. The exit rate $\phi=0.0033$, set $b^{out} = b$.
        \item There are thus fifteen parameters to estimate for each gender-education group $\rho,\underline{p}, \bar{p},\kappa_1, \kappa_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, b, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3, \eta, \delta, \lambda_e$, and $\lambda_u$
         \end{itemize}
    
     

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{identification}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The seven Poisson rates $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3, \eta, \delta, \lambda_e,\lambda_u$ have direct data counterparts and are thus exactly identified.
        \item For the rest of 8 parameters, they use the mean,variance, and skewness of log wages distribution together with the average wage change during job-to-job transitions evaluated at actual experience years from 1 to 10.
        \item These add up to 40 moments and they use GMM to estimate the 8 parameters.
         \end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Inroduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Innovation is the key factor in driving economic growth and gaining competitive advantage for one country.
        \item But the process of innovation may be very long, unpredictable and lead to total failure.
        \item Financial markets play critical roles in reducing financing costs, allocating scarce resources, evaluating innovative projects, managing risk.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Question}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hypothesis 1. Equity market development will promote innovation in industries that are more dependent on
        external finance. Credit market development will discourage innovation in industries that are more dependent on
        external finance.
        \item Equity market investors share upside returns and there are no collateral requirements for equity financing
        \item Equity markets produce useful information. Under rational expectations, investors are able to extract the relevant yet noisy information from equilibrium prices
        \item Innovative firms often have unstable and limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to service debt.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Question}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hypothesis 2. Equity market development will promote innovation in high-tech industries. Credit market development will discourage innovation in high-tech industries.
        \item Industries that are more high-tech intensive are typically riskier than industries that are less prone to high technologies.
        \item Equity markets provide a rich set of risk management tools, encouraging investors to shift their portfolios toward projects not only with higher risk but also higher expected returns.
        \item Banks excessively avoid risky activities and failures. Therefore, their control could lead firms to under-invest in innovative projects with high uncertainty
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Data and Measurement}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data and Measurement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Patent_{j,i,t}$, is the number of eventually granted patents in two-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) industry $j$ that are invented
        by individuals or non-government institutions from country $i$ in year $t$. 
        \item It's from the NBER patent database that contains detailed information of all USPTO-approved patents in the period 1976-2006.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data and Measurement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Equity_{i,t}$ is the ratio of country $i$'s stock market capitalization in year $t$ over its GDP in year $t$. Stock market capitalization means the summation of share price times the number
        of shares outstanding of each listed stock.
        \item $Credit_{i,t}$ is the ratio of country $i$'s domestic credit provided by the banking sector in year $t$ over its GDP in year $t$. They collect these annual financial market development data
        from  the World Development Indicators and Global Development Finance database.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data and Measurement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They construct industry $j$'s share of total value added in manufacturing industries in country $i$ in year $t$, $Value-Added_{j,i,t}$,using the Industrial Statistics Database of the United
        Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
        \item They also construct $US-Export_{j,i,t}$, as industry $j$'s share of country $i$'s total export to the US in year $t$, using the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics database.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data and Measurement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They collect the year-end data of cash flows from operations, capital expenditures, and R\&D expenses of all public firms listed in three major US stock exchanges from the Compustat database.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data and Measurement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They calculate each firm's dependence on external finance as capital expenditures plus R\&D expenses minus cash flows from operations, all divided by the sum of capital expenditures and R\&D expenses. Each industry's dependence on
         external finance is calculated as the median of all firms'dependence on external finance in a year. They then compute $Dependence_j$ as the time series median of industry $j$'s dependence on external finance.
        \item They calculate each firm's high-tech intensiveness as the time series median of its annual gross growth in R\&D expenses during the period 1976-2006. 
              Industry $j$'s high-tech intensiveness is calculated as the cross sectional median of all firms' high-tech intensiveness in that industry.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Identification}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Identification}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Innovation_{j,i,t+1}=\beta_0+\beta_1(Equity_{i,t} \times Industry_j)+\beta_2(Credit_{i,t} \times Industry_j)+\beta_3 Value-Added_{j,i,t}+\beta_4 US-Export_{j,i,t}+\eta_{i,t+1}+\mu_j+\varepsilon_{i,j,t+1}$
        \item $Innovation_{j,i,t+1}$ is $Patent_{j,i,t}$ here. $Industry_j$ is either $Dependence_j$ or $High-tech_j$ that captures economic mechanisms and helps with identification.
        \item $\eta_{i,t+1}$ is the country-year fixed effect. $\mu_j$ is the industry fixed effect.
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{conclusion}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By Using a large data set that includes 32 countries between 1976 and 2006 and a fixed effects identification strategy, they show that industries that are more dependent on external finance and that are more high-tech intensive
        exhibit a disproportionally higher innovation level in countries with better developed equity markets. However, the development of credit markets appears to discourage innovation.
        \item Economies with good growth opportunities develop financial markets to provide the funds necessary to support their good growth prospects.Simultaneity problem may still exist.
