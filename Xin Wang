\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gender wage gap is persistent and prevalent in the US.
       \item This paper shows turnover and human capital dynamics are important factors in explaining gender wage gap.
       \item They establish a structural model of wage dynamics, estimate it using NLSY79 data and do some counterfactual analysis.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They use NLSY79 data and focus on period after the individuals' graduation.
       \item They exclude the individuals who never get employed after 15 years of graduation. Unemployment and out-of-the-labor force are both treated as non-employment state.
       \item They distinguish two group:high school graduates are those who have 12 to 15 years of schooling, college graduates are those who have 16 to 20 years of schooling.
       \item They restrict their sample to non-minority individuals who did not have any child while in school.
       \item They have 1,376 men and 1,331 women in the high school group, and 653 men and 681 women in the college group.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $w_{i t}$ denotes the log hourly real wage of individual $i$ in week $t$, $M_{i t}$ denotes the number
        of months worker $i$ has spent in the labor force , and $\tau_y$ are calendar year
        fixed effects. 
         $ w_{i t}=\beta_0Male_i+\sum_{m=1}^{180}[\alpha_m \mathbb{1}[M_{i t}=m]+\beta_m(Male_i \mathbb{1}[M_{i t}=m])]+\tau_y+\varepsilon_{i t}$

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The structure of the model is same for four groups(man-high school,man-college,woman-high school and woman-college).
       \item Workers exit the labor market permanently at rate $\phi$,new inflow of workers enter at same rate.
       \item Workers' initial human capital level, $\varepsilon$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $A(\varepsilon)$ with support $[\underline{\varepsilon}, \bar{\varepsilon}]$. a type $\varepsilon$ worker with
       actual experience $x$ has productivity$ y = \varepsilon e^{\rho x}$.
       \item Jobs are heterogeneous in productivity, $p$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $\Gamma(p)$ with support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$
       \item Every employer posts  wage rate $z$ to all potential applicants,worker gets paid a wage $w = zy$,The productivity of the match $(y, p)$ is $yp$, so employers' profit is $(p-z)y$
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Model}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item A worker can have children in either employment or unemployment at Poisson rate $\gamma_1$
       \item  For those who are employed at childbirth, a share $\eta$ will return to their old jobsâ€” their childcare period is denoted by $OJ$ and ends at rate $\gamma_2$.
       \item Childcare period for who do not return to their old jobs is denoted by $NJ$ and terminates at a different rate $\gamma_3$
       \item Jobs are heterogeneous in productivity, $p$, drawn from an exogenous distribution $\Gamma(p)$ with support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$
       \item  Those who are unemployed at childbirth will enter childcare periods of the $NJ$ type. If the worker has a second child while in $OJ$, she goes into the state $NJ$.The probability that the worker returns to her old job, $\eta$, is taken as exogenous in the model.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Worker Behavior}

    \textbf{Proposition 1}. For a fixed $F(\cdot)$ with bounded and non-negative support, optimal job search implies that all unemployed workers have the same reservation cutoff $z^R$, which exists, is unique and is implicitly defined by\\
   \begin{center}
  $ \zeta_1(z^R-b)+\frac{(r+\phi) \zeta_2}{\lambda_u}(b^{\text {out }}-b)+\rho(b+\frac{\gamma_1}{r+\phi+\gamma_3} b^{\text {out }})$ \\
        $=[\zeta_1(\lambda_u-\lambda_e)-\rho \lambda_u+(r+\phi) \zeta_2] \int_{z^R}^{\bar{z}} \frac{\bar{F}(z)}{r+q(z)-\rho-\frac{\eta \gamma_1 \gamma_2}{r+\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2}} d z $
\end{center} 
        where $\zeta_1=r+\phi+\gamma_1-\frac{\gamma_1 \gamma_3}{r+\phi+\gamma_3}$, $\zeta_2=\frac{\lambda_u \gamma_1 \eta\left(\gamma_3-\gamma_2\right)}{\left(r+\phi+\gamma_3\right)\left(r+\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2\right)}$, $q(z)=\phi+\delta+\gamma_1+\lambda_e \bar{F}(z)$


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Employer}
 
    \textbf{Proposition 2}. The optimal policy function, $z =\xi(p)$, i) can be expressed as \\
     \begin{center}
       $\xi(p)=p-M(\xi(p))^2 \int_{z^R}^p \frac{1}{M(\xi(p^{\prime}))^2} d p^{\prime}$
       \end{center} 
       where  $M(\xi(p))=q(\xi(p))-\frac{\eta \gamma_1 \gamma_2}{\phi+\gamma_1+\gamma_2}-\rho$ and \\
       ii) $\xi(p)$ is increasing in $p$ so that more productive jobs post higher wage offers. \\

       \textbf{Theorem 1}. For any $\rho > \phi$, a steady-state market equilibrium exists and is unique.

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{identification}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  They normalize the minimum worker type $\log(\varepsilon)$ to zero. Workers' initial productivity distribution as $A(\varepsilon) \sim Weibull(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ over the support $[1,\infty)$.
        \item  The productivity distribution of jobs is parametrized as $\Gamma(p) \sim Weibull(\kappa_1,\kappa_2)$ over the support $[\underline{p}, \bar{p}]$.
        \item  Monthly discount factor $r = 0.0041$. The exit rate $\phi=0.0033$, set $b^{out} = b$.
        \item There are thus fifteen parameters to estimate for each gender-education group $\rho,\underline{p}, \bar{p},\kappa_1, \kappa_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, b, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3, \eta, \delta, \lambda_e$, and $\lambda_u$
         \end{itemize}
    
     

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{identification}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The seven Poisson rates $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3, \eta, \delta, \lambda_e,\lambda_u$ have direct data counterparts and are thus exactly identified.
        \item For the rest of 8 parameters, they use the mean,variance, and skewness of log wages distribution together with the average wage change during job-to-job transitions evaluated at actual experience years from 1 to 10.
        \item These add up to 40 moments and they use GMM to estimate the 8 parameters.
         \end{itemize}
