\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Question}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Joseph Schumpeter argued in 1911 that ``financial intermediaries play a pivotal role in economic development because they choose which ``firms get to use
        society's savings (see Schumpeter, 1934).
       \item They empirically assess the impact of ``nancial intermediaries on private savings rates, capital accumulation, produc-
       tivity growth, and overall economic growth.
       \item Try to understand cross-country di!erences in both the level and growth rate of total factor productivity.
       \item They examine whether economies with better-developed ``nancial intermediaries (i) grow faster, (ii) enjoy faster rates of productivity growth, (iii) experience more rapid capital accumulation, and (iv) have higher savings
       rates.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{literature Review}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To measure financial intermediary development, they employ a variable called Private Credit, which equals the value of credits by financial
        intermediaries to the private sector divided by GDP.
        \item e compute Growth for each country by running a least-squares regression of the logarithm of real per capita GDP on a constant and a time trend. We use the
        estimated coefficient on the time trend as the growth rate.
        \item Capgrowth equals the growth rate of the per capita physical capital stock.They use the aggregate real investment series from the Penn-World Tables (5.6, henceforth PWT) and the perpetual inventory method
        with a depreciation rate of seven percent to compute capital stocks in later years.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{literature Review}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In terms of exogeneity, the English, French, and German legal systems were spread mainly through occupation and colonialism. Thus, we take the legal origin of a country as an exogenous endowment. Furthermore, we provide specification tests regarding
        the validity of the instruments
        \item a growing body of evidence suggests that legal origin helps shape financial development.
        \item LLSV (1998) show that the legal origin of a country materially in#uences its legal treatment of shareholders, the laws governing creditor rights, the efficiency of contract enforcement, and
        accounting standards.
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{literature Review}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the pure cross-sectional analysis we use data averaged for 63 countries over 1960-1995, such that there is one observation per country. The cross-country sample for private saving has 61 countries over the period 1971-1995. 
        The basic regression takes the form 
        \item $Y_i=\alpha+\beta Finance_i+\gamma^'X_i+\varepsilon_i$
        \item They use natural logarithms of the regressors in the regressions of Growth, Capgrowth, and Prod
        \item They construct a panel that consists of data for 77 countries over the period 1960-1995. They average the data over seven non-overlapping 5-year periods. The panel sample for private saving includes 72 countries and five 5-year periods
        between 1971 and 1995.
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{literature Review}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $y_{i,t}=\alpha^'X^1_{i,t-1}+\beta^'X^2_{i,t}+\mu_i+\lambda_t+\varepsilon_{i,t}$
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Measurement}
\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Basic Game}
    \begin{itemize}
         \item They consider a class of static games, indexed by realizations of covariates $x \in X$. Let $N = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ be the finite set of players; each player $i \in N$ chooses an action $y_i$ from the finite set
        $Y_i$. Both the actions' space $Y = \times_{i\in N} Y_i$ and $N$ are the same across different games
       \item Each player $i$ is characterized by a payoff type $\varepsilon_i \in \mathcal{E}_i$. Payoff types $\varepsilon = (\varepsilon_1, \ldots , \varepsilon_n)$
       are distributed according to the cdf $F(\cdot; \theta_\varepsilon)$, parametrized by the finite dimensional vector
      $ \theta_\varepsilon \in \Theta_\varepsilon$. $F$ as players' prior.
       \item Payoffs to player $i$, denoted by $\pi_i$, depend
       on her payoff type and on action profiles. Observable covariates $x$ and finite dimensional
       payoff parameters $\theta_\pi \in \Theta_\pi$ also affect payoffs. The payoff function $\pi_i$, for any pair $(x, \theta_\pi)$,
       is $\pi_i(Â·; x, \theta_\pi) : Y \times \mathcal{E}_i \to R$. $\varepsilon$ is independent of $x$.
       
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Information Structure}
\begin{itemize}
       \item Every player $i$ knows her payoff type $\varepsilon_i$, as well as parameters $\theta$ and covariates $x$, but may
       not observe $\varepsilon_{-i}$
       \item They assume that in each game with covariates $x$ players receive a private signal $\tau_i^x = (\varepsilon_i, \tilde{\tau}_i^x)$.
       \item An information structure $S^x$ specifies the set of signals a player may receive and
       the probability of receiving them. $S^x = (T^x, \{ P^x_{\tilde{\tau} \mid \varepsilon} : \varepsilon \in \mathcal{E} \})$
       \item $T^x = \mathcal{E} \times \tilde{T}^x$ and $\tilde{T}^x$ is a complete, separable metric space that represents the support
       of the vector of additional signals $\tilde{\tau}^x = (\tilde{\tau}_1^x , \ldots , \tilde{\tau}_n^x)$. $\mathcal{S} = (S^x)_{x \in X}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
