\section{Introduction}
\par
Centralized financial markets are often all-to-all trading platforms with strict transparency policy. 
For example, Many main stock exchanges, American Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, 
are organized in this way. But nowadays more than half of the financial trade take place in the
decentralized markets (or over-the-counter market) rather than centralized markets. Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are typically extremely fragmented. The investors may trade with only one
dealer or a few dealers. There is often very weak transparency policy in OTC markets. Investors don't know how many quotes can be traded before their negotiation with dealers. The quates and 
prices are not publicly announced, which may lead to investors' imperfect information about overall market conditions. The typical assets that are traded in the OTC markets are fixed-income securities, 
derivatives, repos, and federal funds loans. In 2018, the value of all domestic assets traded in OTC markets are more than 50000 billion US dollars which exceed the assets value traded in the 
centralized markets by over 20000 billion US dollars (\citet{weill2020search}). 
\par
The OTC markets play a key role in 2008 financial crisis and are in the center of many policy debates. In the financial crisis, the trading volume in many OTC markets collapse, which leads to 
debate on the reactions the government should take. Should the government engage in large-scale purchase of mortgage-backed securities (MBS)? Should the assets traded previously in the OTC 
markets now be traded in the more centralized financial markets with more transparent information disclosure mechanism? Should those credit derivatives be centrally cleared to deal with systemic 
risk existed in the OTC markets for credit derivatives? All of these policy debates require rigorous theoretical analysis for OTC markets as basis.
\par
It is very natural to apply search theory to the study OTC markets. There are several reasons to justify search theory provides reasonable and tractable method. First, OTC markets are typically 
extremely fragmented, which means investors need time to search for the potential dealer rather than can find dealers instantly in the centralized financial market. Second, investors can choose who 
they want to trade and when they trade, there is no restriction which force the investor to trade with any group or any particular dealer. Third, there is opportunity cost which may be enhanced by the 
pricing mechanism for investors to delay the trade. Financially distressed institutions are often willing to concede a huge magnitude of price, which support that delaying trade is very costly \citet{duffie2010presidential}.

\section{Benchmark Model}
\par
Most literature analyzing OTC markets follow the pioneering work by \citet{duffie2005over}. In their model, they assume there are four types of investors according to whether they endowed and 
hold assets (pay dividends each period) and whether they need to pay a cost when they hold assets. At the successive event times of a Poisson process, all four types of investors can contact another 
investor from the investor population followed with a uniform distribution. They also assume investor can meet with a marketmaker when the investor needs to bargain the term of trade with 
marketmakers. Marketmakers can buy the assets from $lo$ investors (hold assets but need to pay a fixed cost) and sell assets to $hn$ (don't hold assets and don't need to pay cost when hold) investors. 
Meanwhile, marketmakers have access to an interdealer market where marketmakers can trade the assets immediately.
\par
They prove there is a unique constant steady-state equilibrium in their model. In equilibrium, only $lo$ investors and $hn$ investors want to trade. They bargain over the price of assets when 
they contact each other. When they meet with the marketmakers, they also bargain over the price. An investor's bargaining power depends on the availability (how quickly she can find another 
counterparty or another marketmaker) of other potential trader. An marketmaker's bargaining power depends on the price interdealer offers. 
\par
They consider their model in several extreme cases. First, when there is only a monopolistic marketmaker, the ask price (when marketmaker sell the assets to $lo$ investors) is larger than the 
price negotiated between $hn$ and $lo$ investors, and the bid price (when marketmaker buy the assets from $hn$ investors) is lower than the price negotiate between $hn$ and $lo$ investors. 
Second, when investors contact each other more quickly or the intermediation by competing marketmakers become faster, the three prices converge to the same price which determined in the 
Walrasian equilibrium, while the result become a little different in monopolistic marketmaker case. If investors contact with each other more quickly, the bid-ask spread (difference between ask price 
and bid price) disappears. However, if investors contact with marketmaker more frequently, the bid-ask spread will increase due to the relatively poorer outside options for the investors. If the 
marketmaker already meet the most need for trading, then it is harder for investor to find a counterparty herself, which will lower the bargaining position of investors with marketmaker. Third, 
they consider the case where the investor may have different level of access to marketmakers, they show those investors with better access to marketmaker will face smaller bid-ask spread. There may 
be no chance to trade for those investors who have lower search intensity. Fourth, if marketmakers can choose their search intensity, a monopolistic marketmaker will replace many trades between 
$lo$ and $hn$ investor, which will cause efficiency loss. The social welfare may be even worse in the competitive marketmaker case where marketmakers provide even more intermediation.
\section{Following development}
\par
After \citet{duffie2005over}, many researchers try to reconsider their model in the new environment and extend their model into different directions. The following literature review 
is organized by the new methodology or new theme the researchers consider in their papers.

\subsection{Fully Decentralized Markets}

\subsection{Entry Decision}
\par
In the benchmark model, the number of investors and marketmakers are exogeneously given. They can't choose to enter or exit markets. Many researchers study the effect of endogenous entry decisions in the models.
\citet{afonso2011liquidity} shows the entry of investors can reduce trading cost, but also may casue concentration on one side of market which reduce the return to enter the markets. These two effects have different 
effects on new investors' entry decision. \citet{atkeson2015entry} establish a model to analyze the welfare effect of bankers' decisions on entry and role in the markets. They show bankers have two incentive (hedge risk 
and make intermediation profits) to enter the markets. There is often too many bankers entering markets as dealers and too little bankers entering markets as customers than the social optimality. Bankers may exit too much 
than the social optimality when the economy faces a negative shock. \citet{gavazza2016empirical} finds excessive entry of dealers which causing welfare loss in the secondary market of commercial aircraft. \citet{sambalaibat2022theory} consider
 a model for bond and credit default swap (CDS) markets where investors can decide on their participation. They show CDS can attract new investors into the credit market and increase the price and liquidity of bonds.
 \citet{10.1093/restud/rdac014} propose a model in which investors can invest on different contact technology. If the cost of investment on contact technology is linear, there will be overinvestment on contact technology in equilibrium.

\subsection{Repeated Trade}
\par
In the labor search model, such as \citet{burdett1998wage},workers usually can have a long-term relationship with firms and their relationship is exclusive. Unlike what the labor search models
often assume, in the most search models of OTC markets, buyer and seller can only trade once and they can't form any long-term relationship. There are few exception. \citet{zhang2018liquidity} 
establishs a framework in which dealers and traders can form a long-term relationship to understand the Liquidity misallocation in OTC markets.\citet{zhu2012finding} provides a dynamic model of
opaque OTC markets. They show if the seller repeat concacting the same buyer, it will reveal the limited outside options of seller to buyer, which lead to worse price of assets offered by buyer.
\citet{afonso2013trading} also show that trading relationships is not exclusive in the US overnight interbank lending market. Borrowers and lenders can form many simultaneous relationships. 
\subsection{Asset Holdings}
\par
Because \citet{duffie2005over} assume investors have linear utility, they can restrict their attension to the case investors either hold one or zero units of asset. If we assume the investors have 
more sophisticated utility, then we should consider how the investors decide on the amount of assets they hold. \citet{garleanu2009portfolio} finds the optimal portfolio choice of investors depend
on the liquidity when they remove the assumption of either one or zero units of asset holdings.\citet{lagos2009liquidity} shows,by assuming unrestricted asset holdings, the individual asset demands 
shape the volume of trading, bid-ask spreads, and trading delays.Recent literature consider the unrestricted asset holdings in fully decentralized markets. \citet{afonso2015trade} develop a search model 
for federal fund markets which explains the determinants of federal fund rate and market reallocation. In the work by \citet{uslu2019pricing}, he assumes investors are heterogenous in preferences, 
inventories, and meeting rates. The Investors with higher meeting rates determine the intermediation patterns and they tend to have more extreme asset holdings. \citet{uslu2019liquidity} propose a 
dynamic model with multi-asset holdings and show how cross-asset spillover effects shape the trade volume, price dispersion based on their model.
\subsection{Structural Estimation}
\par
Rigorous empirical studies focusing on structural estimation of search model for OTC markets are sparse. Among the rare literature on structural research of OTC markets, \citet{feldhutter2012same} 
uses the difference between prices paid by small traders and those paid by large traders to identify the liquidity crises based on a search model of OTC markets with periods investors have selling 
pressures. He proposes a maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters of the model by using corporate bond transactions data from the TRACE database. \citet{gavazza2016empirical} estimates a search 
model of OTC markets to quantify the effect of trading friction on welfare and the effects of intermediaries on trade in the commercial aircraft markets.\citet{brancaccio2017learning}  propose 
and estimate a dynamic model of OTC markets which explains the dealers' learning in the municipal bond market. \citet{liu2020dealers} proposes a model with dealers choosing different search 
intensities and estimate the model using transaction data on U.S. corporate bonds. \citet{coen2022structural} propose and estimate a model of OTC markets in which firms have heterogeneous search costs.
This enable them to study the reliance of market liquidity and its effects on trade stress,bank capital regulation and new trading technologies.

We show that a rich market structure emerges both in equilibrium and in an optimal allocation. There is continuous heterogeneity in market access under weak regularity conditions. If the cost per contact is constant, heterogeneity is governed by a power law and there are middlemen, market participants with unboundedly high contact rates who account for a positive fraction of meetings. Externalities lead to overinvestment in equilibrium, and policies that reduce investment in the contact technology can improve welfare. We relate our findings to important features of real-world trading networks.}",
